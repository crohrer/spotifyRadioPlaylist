Clone this repo into a local directory\r\n2. Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and insert your own credentials & radio station.\r\nYou can obtain a clientId & clientSecret by [registering a new application](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications).\r\nYou can use the predefined radio settings for [Radio FM4](http://fm4.orf.at) or define settings for your own radio station. You need a URL to a page that lists the recently played tracks and a jQuery style selector for title and artist. I added a flag for FM4s weird HTML markup - this should be set to false for others.\r\nI have tested only [one other radio station](http://www.novaplanet.com/radionova), so this may require some adjustments in the code for other stations.\r\n3. Run `npm install`\r\n4. Run `node main.js`\r\n5. Open the displayed URL in your browser & grant permission for your app to change your playlists. This will open a page on localhost which you can close. Now you find two new files: `accessToken` and `refreshToken`. They contain the secret information to authenticate the user with spotify, so handle with care!\r\n\r\nThis should have added the first tracks to your playlist already. Every time you run `node main.js` again, the script will check if there are new tracks that have not been added to the playlist yet.\r\n\r\nYou may want to run this on a server via cronjob every X minutes or so (depending on how many results your trackservice delivers in one page).\r\n\r\n1. Clone this repo on your server into a _non-public_ directory\r\n2. Copy your local `accessToken` and `refreshToken` onto the server\r\n3. Copy your local `config.json` onto the server and change the last entry to `\"localEnvironment\": false`\r\n4. Run `npm install`\r\n5. Configure your cronjob to run `node main.js` every X minutes (don't forget to change to the correct directory first!)\r\n","google":"UA-71897992-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
